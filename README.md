# YouLearn-ish

YouLearn-ish is an iOS application designed to help users learn intentionally by reducing distractions. The app takes inspiration from the familiar YouTube-style interface but introduces a dedicated Learn Feed to provide a focused and educational experience.

## Features

- Dedicated Learn tab showing only educational content
- Choose subjects such as science, coding, math, languages, and more
- Clean, modern YouTube-like design with smooth scrolling
- Three main sections: For You, Friends, and Learn
- Minimal distractions to support better learning habits

## Purpose

Most social platforms show random, high-stimulation content that breaks focus and makes consistent learning difficult. YouLearn-ish provides an alternative environment where educational content is prioritized, allowing users to turn scrolling time into productive time.
